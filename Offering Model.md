> [!warning] They must sign off on understanding the following:
> - Using a NAS means that you own the data. If you lose it and don't have it properly backed up, you lose it for good.
> - If the NAS goes offline, that means your data isn't accessible.
> - The trade off is that it's significantly cheaper per TB to store data, as well as faster for data transfers. This is extremely handy in our business, and helps us work more efficiently.

**STARTER**: Get off the ground with neatly organized and protected local data storage. No more hacky short-term solutions.

**PRO**: Elevate your setup with a *tailored* local data storage solution, built with your needs in mind, as well as basic networking solutions for remote access.

**STUDIO**: Get the full setup with tailored data storage, tailored networking solutions, and customizable setup with scripting and automation.

# Data Storage Scheme
## Starter (baseline template)

- **Set up NAS or other main storage device**
	- Set up NAS/RAID (Synology only)
	- Add UPS and surge protection
	- Train employees on how it works and how to access data
- **Organize data for easier handling**
	- Separate hot (current) from cold (archival) media
- **Implement a strong backup strategy**
	- Implement resilient backup strategy, preferably 3-2-1 method:
		- Live - NAS
		- Backup copy - external drive (client handles this)
		- Off-site/Cloud copy - SF Hosting, B2 (version history, option for append-only)
		- Cold copy (optional) - external drive (client handles this)
- **Be prepared**
	- Clear restore playbooks for drive failure or human error
	- *(If not signing up for retainer)* Maintenance checklist to ensure things are running smoothly

## Pro (includes Starter)

- **Upgrade: Custom NAS**
	- Non-Synology NAS/RAID solutions available (Unraid, TrueNAS, custom build)
	- ***Why upgrade:*** Flexibility with disk storage, drive types, using existing hardware, array configuration, more drive bays
		- *"Use the existing computer hardware that you own or start fresh. We have a solution for you either way."*
- **Upgrade: Improved backup strategy**
	- Automatic syncing to a cold archive (append-only option available)
	- ***Why upgrade:*** You won't have to worry about having to remember to back up to a cold device every month. We will perform the cold backups for you on a monthly basis.

## Studio (includes Starter & Pro)

- **Custom workflows**
	- Custom scripts/automation based on your needs

---
# Networking Scheme

## Pro (baseline template)

- **Set up file sharing (locally and online)**
	- Set up secure file sharing so pre-authorized users can upload/download files anywhere (device-to-device transfers)

## Studio (includes Pro)

- **Upgrade: Tailored file sharing workflow**
	- Set up custom-tailored set of software curated to meet the exact needs of the client's workflow
	- Flexible file sharing schemes: send/receive-only devices, self-hosted cloud
	- Unlock a host of software options and customizable options for file sharing
- **Consultation**
	- Discuss best practices to handle data securely, privately, and without outsider tampering
	- Discuss ways to optimize networking infrastructure to increase speeds and reduce headache (consulting on switches, routers, network topology, etc.)
