1. **Boost your data storage setup to be more organized and protected against loss**
	- **Short term data storage** - abundant storage, RAID/NAS
	- **Long term data storage** - archiving, validating data, making sure sure it's accessible when needed
	- **Backup strategy** - resilient backup strategy, protection against hardware failure and human error, clear recovery playbook in case of emergency
2. **Improve your workflow to be more efficient and secure**
	- **Tailored networking solutions** - remote secure file access, fast transfer speeds, custom-made networking infrastructure
	- **Tailored project workflow** - make sure everyone who needs access has it
	- **Privacy & security** - secure file sharing protocols, private data transfer workflows, implement general best practices
3. **Tweak things you didn't even know you could**
	- **Customized solutions** - custom-made solutions using programming, automation, and custom networking infrastructure (It doesn't hurt to ask. That's why I'm better than Dropbox)
	- **Counseling** - guide you to solve your data workflow issues
