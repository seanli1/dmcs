# Data Storage Scheme
## Starter

- **Set up NAS or other main storage device**
	- Set up NAS/RAID (Synology only)
	- Add UPS and surge protection
	- Train employees on how it works and how to access data
- **Organize data for easier handling**
	- Separate hot (current) from cold (archival) media
- **Implement a strong backup strategy**
	- Implement resilient backup strategy, preferably 3-2-1 method:
		- Live - NAS
		- Backup copy - external drive (client handles this)
		- Off-site/Cloud copy - SF Hosting, B2 (version history, option for append-only)
		- Cold copy (optional) - external drive (client handles this)
- **Be prepared**
	- Clear restore playbooks for drive failure or human error
	- *(If not signing up for retainer)* Maintenance checklist to ensure things are running smoothly

## Pro (includes Starter)

- **Upgrade: Custom NAS**
	- Non-Synology NAS/RAID solutions available (Unraid, TrueNAS, custom build)
	- ***Why upgrade:*** Flexibility with disk storage, drive types, using existing hardware, array configuration, more drive bays
		- *"Use the existing computer hardware that you own or start fresh. We have a solution for you either way."*
- **Upgrade: Improved backup strategy**
	- Automatic syncing to a cold archive (append-only option available)
	- ***Why upgrade:*** You won't have to worry about having to remember to back up to a cold device every month. We will perform the cold backups for you on a monthly basis.

## Studio (includes Pro)

- **Custom workflows**
	- Custom scripts/automation based on your needs
